# ColdFusion 9+ Script Components
## Community Edition!

The components in this project are contributed by the ColdFusion community, for the ColdFusion Community.

### Installing...

You can simply download the zip of the available components and toss them in the appropriate directory, if you want. (`{cf-install}\CustomTags\com\adobe\coldfusion\`)

It would be easier to update if you use git:

1. Open a terminal prompt at the above directory
1. Run this: `git init;git remote add origin git@github.com:CFCommunity/CFScript-Community-Components.git;git pull`
1. Any time you want to update, simply (go into that directory and) run `git pull`

# Deficiencies!

These are the tags that need to be ported over to script. Godspeed!

## Significant omissions:

* cfcollection 
* cfexchangecalendar    
* cfexchangeconnection  
* cfexchangecontact      
* cfexchangefilter      
* cfexchangemail 
* cfexchangetask 
* cfexecute 
* cfinvoke (support for dynamic method names, please!)
* cfmodule 
* cfoutput (implementation of query looping with grouping)
* cfparam (fix the bug in that enforced requiredness doesnâ€™t work (ie: param name="foo";))
* cfquery (cachedwithin support)
* cfsetting 
* cfwddx 
* cfzip 
* cfzipparam

## Reasonable case

* cfassociate    
* cfcache        
* cfheader      
* cflogin 
* cfloginuser 
* cflogout 
* cfprint      
* cfsharepoint  
* cftimer

## Ambivalent

* cfobjectcache
* cfreport
* cfreportparam
* cfupdate

# Hey Adobe!

You are welcome, and encouraged, to ship these in future versions of ColdFusion. Please do, at least where appropriate. In some cases it just doesn't look and feel right to use CFCs to make these features. When that's the case, they are included here only as a stop-gap so that we can _actually write full-script components_. Please, where it makes sense, still write the features in Java. But where this implementation looks and feels natural, by all means, run with it! It'll make life better for everyone!
